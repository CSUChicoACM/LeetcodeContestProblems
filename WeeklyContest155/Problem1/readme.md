Given an array of distinct integers arr, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. 

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair [a, b] follows

    a, b are from arr
    a < b
    b - a equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in arr


EXAMPLES:  
`Input: arr = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Explanation: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order. `


`Input: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]
Output: [[1,3]]`
